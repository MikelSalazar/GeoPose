# GeoPose Standard Working Group (SWG)

Welcome to the GeoPose SWG GitHub Repo.

This SWG will develop a standard data exchange format for GeoPose.
After performing scan of landscape and requirements analyses, the SWG will define the standard and illustrate it with UML diagrams, and examples in formats such as JSON. The data structure will be defined with a limited set of pre-defined fields, building on the default practice of using JSON to store and exchange more or less any data today.

To determine how well the proposed standard works in real world spatial computing scenarios and to assess its ease of use for average developers, there will be multiple implementations and use cases examined. Best practices will be compiled when possible.

The SWG will then examine whether the proposed standard maintains interoperability with the OGC Standards Baseline and assess whether extensions of existing standards could achieve the goals of GeoPose.
