# GeoPose Standards Working Group (SWG)

Welcome to the GeoPose SWG GitHub
A standard data exchange format for Geopose
The initial proposal is to define the standard and to illustrate it with a JSON encoding. The data structure will be defined with a limited set of pre-defined fields, building on the default practice of using JSON to store and exchange more or less any data today.

3.1.4     Explore and test practical use cases for Geopose
To determine how well the proposed standard works in real world spatial computing scenarios and to assess its ease of use for average developers, there will be multiple implementations and use cases examined. Best practices will be compiled when possible.

3.1.5     Assess the standard with respect to the OGC Standards Baseline
Examine whether the proposed standard maintains interoperability with the OGC Standards Baseline and assess whether extension of existing standards could achieve the goals of geopose. The SWG will also explore the need to develop additional geopose related standards to better support the use cases explored in the 3rd objective.
