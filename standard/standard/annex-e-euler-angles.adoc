== GeoPose Use and Interpretation of Euler Angles

Euler angles come in two forms: with reference to an initial set of unchanging world coordinates or with reference to local coordinates that undergo each of the rotations. In addition, the order of the axes about which the rotations are performed must be specified. Finally, the unit of measure must be specified for the amount of each of the rotations.

GeoPose shall use rotations about local coordinates, in the axis order z, y, x, and with the degree as the unit of measure.
